# Time Series Prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

## Introduction

This project focuses on utilizing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for time series prediction of monthly milk production. LSTM is well-suited for handling sequences of data and capturing long-term dependencies.

## Problems Addressed by LSTM

Traditional regression-based forecasting models often struggle with several challenges:

- They do not effectively handle noisy, missing data, or outliers.
- Modeling non-linear relationships can be difficult.
- Incorporating multiple influencing factors into predictions is challenging.

Neural networks, particularly LSTM, address these limitations by:

- Learning noisy and non-linear relationships effectively.
- Supporting multivariate and multi-step forecasting tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the monthly milk production dataset, available [here](https://github.com/plotly/datasets/blob/master/monthly-milk-production-pounds.csv).

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Loading and Preprocessing Data

### Step 2: Train-Test Split and Scaling

### Step 3: TimeseriesGenerator

### Step 4: LSTM Model

### Step 5: Making Predictions

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of implementing LSTM for time series prediction, specifically using monthly milk production data. LSTM's capability to handle sequences and capture long-term dependencies makes it suitable for forecasting tasks in various domains.
